# Autism-Detection
Autism detection using machine learning on screening data to identify ASD tendencies.

# Autism Detection using Machine Learning

This project analyzes autism screening data and applies machine learning techniques to identify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tendencies. The goal is to assist early screening by finding key patterns in behavioral and demographic data.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `Autism_Screening_Data_Combined.csv`, containing demographic and screening responses.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training for autism detection
- Performance evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
